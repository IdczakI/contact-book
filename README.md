# The Contact Book
This is the simple contact storage application with 
the ability to add, edit, copy, search and delete contacts.

All actions are handling with buttons except searching - in
this case you just need to enter the string in the text field.

The data is loaded and saved in the csv file.

The "Use Contact" option is unfortunately not available yet.

The application was created to increase the author's 
programming skills. Any comments are welcome.
